#Overview
##This notebook presents a structured analysis of aviation accident data. It follows the CRISP-DM methodology, offering insight into understanding and preparing data for decision-making in aviation safety.

# Business Understanding

Aviation safety is essential to public trust and operational efficiency. Understanding past accidents helps stakeholders identify systemic issues and implement safety improvements.

# Business Problem

![Cover](images/image2.avif)
The company is planning to expand into new industries as part of a broader diversification strategy. One of the targeted areas is aviation — specifically, the purchase and operation of aircraft for commercial and private services. However, the company currently lacks knowledge about the aviation industry, particularly regarding the safety and risk profiles of different aircraft.

The objective is to identify which aircraft models present the lowest operational risk, using historical data on aircraft incidents and accidents. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that will guide the head of the new aviation division in selecting the safest and most reliable aircraft to purchase.

To support this effort, aviation safety data will be sourced, explored, and analyzed, with the results translated into actionable business recommendations that reduce risk and support informed decision-making in this new venture.

# Data Understanding  

We are using a dataset of aviation accidents with attributes such as weather, aircraft model, number of injuries, and flight phase. This helps in assessing causes and risk zones.
